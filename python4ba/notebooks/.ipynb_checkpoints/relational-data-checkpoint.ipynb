    "In data analysis, you often need to combine multiple data sets to answer the questions that you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, multiple related sets (tables) of data are called relational data. In relational (SQL) databases (DBs), each table is called a relation. Two tables (relations) may have a relationship between each other via a PK (primary key) and a FK (foreign key). It is also not uncommon to have more than two tables related to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "To work with relational data, we typically need to from three families of operations: \n",
    "- **Mutating joins**, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.\n",
    "- **Filtering joins**, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.\n",
    "- **Set operations**, which treat observations as if they were set elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have learned relational databases and SQL (Structured Query Language), you should find many of these concepts and operations familiar. \n",
